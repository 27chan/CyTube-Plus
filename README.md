## About

***

### Q: What is CyTube Plus?

**A:** It's an easy to configure, powerful <b>JavaScript/CSS library</b> for [CyTube](https://github.com/calzoneman/sync) channels administrators, adding new features and enhancements. Latest release works with **2.4.5** CyTube version.

Latest release includes links from my personal example set of channel themes, logos and emotes. During library customization you can leave it, remove any element, or expand it by adding your own links.

### Q: Where can I see CyTube Plus in action?

**A:** Go to example http://cytu.be/r/plus channel. All library options in this room are enabled by default.

## Installation

### Simple installation

> Note: some features will be disabled.

1. Go to your channel's "Moderation Menu" and select "Channel Options".
2. In "External Javascript" field enter ready-to-use library URL given below, and save:
   `https://raw.github.com/zimny-lech/CyTube-Plus/master/main-ready.js`
3. Congratulations, your have just installed basic version of CyTube Plus!

### Customized, advanced installation

> Note: don't be afraid to configure! Go to [Wiki](https://github.com/zimny-lech/CyTube-Plus/wiki) for help. If all fails, copy default `main.js` file, and try to change variables one by one - this way you will find what's wrong.

1. Open content of `main.js` file in a text editor.
2. Scroll down to configuration sections and configure library according to your wishes<sup>1</sup>. All options are explained for non-advanced users.
3. Save customized library to your file hosting (e.g. <i>Dropbox</i><sup>2</sup>), project hosting (e.g. <i>GitHub</i><sup>3</sup>) or to your own server<sup>4</sup>.
4. Enter your library file location in "Channel Options", and save.

<sup>1</sup><i>Note: I highly recommend you to change default `CookiePrefix` variable (to prevent from using cookies from other channels).</i><br/><sup>2</sup><i>Warning! Always use `dl.dropboxusercontent.com` URL instead of `www.dropbox.com`.</i><br/><sup>3</sup><i>Warning! Always use `raw.github.com` URL instead of `github.com`.</i><br/><sup>4</sup><i>Warning! You must be able to **access .js file directly** (browser's URL must contain `.js` extension, not `.php` etc.).</i>

**Additional recommended actions for more advanced users:**

1. Copy all files used by CyTube Plus (JS, CSS, images) to your own location (using my default URLs by many users may increase library responding time).
2. Change all necessary URL paths during library customization.
